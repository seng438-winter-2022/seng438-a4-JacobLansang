# Introduction


# Analysis of 10 Mutants of the Range class 

# Report all the statistics and the mutation score for each test class



# Analysis drawn on the effectiveness of each of the test classes

# A discussion on the effect of equivalent mutants on mutation score accuracy

# A discussion of what could have been done to improve the mutation score of the test suites

# Why do we need mutation testing? Advantages and disadvantages of mutation testing

| Advantages      |  Disadvantages   |
| --------------- | --------------- |
| Able to detect most faults in source code   |  Hard to implement   |
| Can help to find out errors in test cases | Can lead to confusion due to complex mutants created and mistakes in the original code |
|  Improves quality of software |  Can be time-consuming |
|  Has a high level of error detection as it finds code ambiguity and incorrect values in variables during early stages |  Is not applicable for black box testing |

# Explain your SELENUIM test case design process

# Explain the use of assertions and checkpoints

# how did you test each functionaity with different test data

# Discuss advantages and disadvantages of Selenium vs. Sikulix

|Selenium      |  Sikulix   |
| --------------- | --------------- |
| It is a simple chromium extension, hence easier to install and get started | It is a legacy app (jar file) and took more effort to get started    |

# How the team work/effort was divided and managed

In order to complete the Part A, we all joined together on a call and one team member shared their screen. All together, we then went through the work together. We collectively decided what to write for our tests, and the person sharing their screen was in charge of writing down our suggestions. This was very effective, since 4 people were tackling a problem at the same time.
